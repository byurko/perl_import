Project: perl_import
Author: Brian Yurko

The purpose of this project is to:

parse file.xml using Perl and store the data in a local SQLite database
ensure that duplicate values are not created upon importing this file subsequent times
create a web application to display the results stored in the database

There are several areas of this project where I could spend additional time solving problems that are above and beyond the manditory scope of the request.
Unfortunately I have not had extra time to invistigate these options. For example, I could have composed Perl code which was more object oriented.
I could have written better error handling methods for a mal-formed or missing XML file.
I plan to write a function that will create the required database if it is missing.

Creating and initializing the SQLite database.
I was thinking that we would check for and if not existing, create the database from DDL within the Perl environment.
Since I have not been using DBI or DBD very often, I will end up predefining the schema for the DB and importing it via 'sqlite3 import.db' .read schema.sql
I have not created adequate foreign key constraints between the three tables.
I have not created indexes for the tables.
I have not created all of the possible NOT NULL constraints
